### Projects
- Global Life Expectancy And Prediction Using Supervised Learning
  
In this [project](https://github.com/nmfel/DataScienceProject/blob/main/Global%20Life%20Expectancy%201960-2022/Global_Life_Expectancy_1960_2022.ipynb), I aim to forecast life expectancy from 2023 to 2030 using a linear regression model. This approach seeks to identify trends in global and regional life expectancy and predict future life expectancy based on historical trends. Additionally, I will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine the phenomena present within the data.
